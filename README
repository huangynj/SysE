# Using SysE

SySE is a collection of NCL libraries for the time being. I plan to eventually
make ruby bindings for the underlying C and fortran libraries, in the not too near unknown future :)

You need to install NCL. Download and install instructions are available at
http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/install.shtml

After this you may load the whole collection of libraries using the NCL load 
command at the top of your scripts. For instance, you may do this after
defining the environmental variable SysE to point to the root of this collection
load "$SysE/lib/ncl/ncl_libs.ncl"
